# Example AI Bot

A simple example AI bot for Red Alert 2 Web. Supports both Allied and Soviet factions.

## Usage

1. Zip the contents of this folder (ensure `bot.ts` is at the zip root)
2. Upload the zip file in the game's bot upload interface
3. Start a game with an AI opponent — the uploaded bot will be used

The uploader accepts TypeScript (`.ts`) files directly — no compilation needed. Type annotations are automatically stripped at load time.

## Features

- Deploys MCV at game start
- Follows a build order: Power → Refinery → Barracks → War Factory → Power → Refinery
- Builds extra power plants when power runs low
- Trains tanks and infantry in a loop
- Sends idle harvesters to gather resources
- Attacks enemy positions when 6+ combat units are available

## API Reference

The bot's `onGameStart` and `onGameTick` callbacks receive a context object:

```
ctx.gameApi        - Read-only game state (players, units, map, rules)
ctx.actionsApi     - Issue commands (build, order units, queue production)
ctx.productionApi  - Query production queue status
ctx.logger         - Logging (info, warn, error, debug)
ctx.playerName     - This bot's player name
ctx.country        - This bot's country name
```

| `getGameObjectData(id)` | Generic object data |
| `canPlaceBuilding(player, name, {rx, ry})` | Check if placement is valid |
| `getBuildingPlacementData(name)` | Get foundation size |
| `getCurrentTick()` | Current game tick |

## Module Format

The bot must use CommonJS `module.exports`:

```typescript
module.exports = {
    id: "unique-id",
    displayName: "Bot Name",
    version: "1.0.0",
    author: "Your Name",
    createBot: function(playerName: string, country: string) {
        return { onGameStart, onGameTick, onGameEvent, dispose };
    }
};
```
